#Yahtzee

Yahtzee is a fully functional game made in JAVA and a GUI. It follows all the rules of the game and outputs meaningful messages based on actions that the user needs to take or has taken. The dice can be held by clicking on them individually, which cause each die clicked to be highlighted. As the game moves on and the dice update, the choices for the different ways to score also change if the criteria had been met. 

An interesting feature of this program is that it also supports MULTIPLAYER! When Yahtzee is first run, a prompt requests the number of players that will play. The game then keeps track of every player's turn and their appropriate scores.

This was a project made for AP Computer Science at the East Brunswick High School (NJ) in 2011. As a student, I was ahead of the rest of the AP class and got an opportunity to attempt this program before all of the other students. Once the idea of Yahtzee was established as a feasable project for the class, all of the students were to work on it in groups of 3+. This particular program was finished way ahead of the rest in the class and was a solo project. Yahtzee was the very first real Object-Oriented program that I have created.

##COMPILATION/EXECUTION
You can compile Yahtzee manually, do it like so:
> javac Die.java DieFaces.java ExFrame.java MousePressListener.java DiceComponent.java Yahtzee.java YahtzeeScore.java

You can then play Yahtzee by running:
> java Yahtzee
